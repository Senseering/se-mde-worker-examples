# Tool Making

A central cornerstone for economic efficiency and productivity in the manufacture of tools in individual and
small series production is laid in the production planning of the individual workpiece components. Today,
tool making is characterized by long throughput times, high costs and a rigid process flow. This is reinforced
by the overriding trend of an increased variety of variants, which results in a higher complexity and number
of manufacturing processes. Together with shorter product life cycles and higher time pressure, the
development of workpieces and their process planning is becoming more and more extensive. For this
reason, the often inflexible development and planning process of complex tools is no longer sustainable
without direct feedback to the customer's requirements. In the past, this deficit of tool manufacturing
companies has already been examined from a primarily organizational point of view with a focus on
production. However, none of the approaches addresses the optimization of manufacturing processes from
a technological point of view, whereby the technology itself is an important cost driver in toolmaking.
An important chance for a more effective development and process planning environment is offered by the
technologies and solution concepts brought forth by Industry 4.0. The cost and time pressure as well as the
increasing complexity in tool manufacturing can be countered by extensive networking of the production
facilities on the shop floor. The basis for this is a functioning and integrated CAx infrastructure as well as
coordinated manufacturing processes. The aim of the pilot line Toolmaking is to research this coordination
between the manufacturing processes and in particular between the manufacturing technologies. For this
several tests with different complex demonstrator geometries were carried out and the data evaluated. The
characteristic manufacturing technologies of milling and die-sinking EDM as well as laser structuring were
considered. In the greasing data below, exemplary input variables can be taken for the above-mentioned
coordination between the manufacturing processes.

A high prognosis ability of the process time, quality and production costs enable an adaptive regulation of
the machining process and thus an increase in production efficiency.
